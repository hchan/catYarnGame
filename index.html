                <p>Yarn2.0 (pronounced: Yarn Two Dot Oh) is a puzzle game. The goal of this game is to give every cat on each tile exactly <b>2</b> yarn balls. Clicking on a tile will drop a yarn on that tile in addition to its orthogonally adjacent (up,right,down,left) tiles where applicable. If a tile already contains 2 yarn balls, the cat on that tile will make a mess of the yarn and henceforth be left with no yarn balls
